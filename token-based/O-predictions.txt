Sputum induction was performed by a method described by PIN et al. , which was slightly modified
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Hypertonic saline ( 4.5 % ) was nebulised using an ultrasonic nebuliser ( DeVilbis 2000

All subjects were pre-treated with an inhaled b2-agonist ( 0.2 mg salbutamol ) before the induction
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Inhalation of the hypertonic saline was made at three intervals of 5 min
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O

FEV1 was monitored before and after each inhalation period
O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O

Following each inhalation period , subjects were advised to blow their nose and rinse their mouth with water before coughing sputum into a sterile container
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Sputum was processed according to the method described by PIZZICHINI et al .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O

At least 400 nonsquamous cells were counted and differential cell counts were expressed as percentage of the total nonsquamous cell count
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The proportion of squamous cells was obtained by counting 400 additional cells and expressing this as a percentage of the total number of cells
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Samples were considered adequate for analysis if the squamous cell contamination was < 20 % and the viability > 50 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The total cell count was calculated by dividing the total number of cells by the volume of processed sputum ( 1 mg=1 mL ) .

ABSTRACT
O

While diesel aerosol exposure assessment has traditionally been based on the mass concentration metric , recent studies have suggested that particle number and surface area concentrations may be more health-relevant
O SubstanceMeasured SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O
O SubstanceMeasured SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

In this study , we evaluated the exposures of three occupational groups-bus drivers , parking garage attendants , and bus mechanics-using the mass concentration of elemental carbon ( EC ) as well as surface area and number concentrations

The three groups had significantly different exposures to workshift TWA EC with the highest levels observed in the bus garage mechanics and the lowest levels in the parking ramp booth attendants

Depending on the exposure metric chosen , the three occupational groups had quite different exposure rankings
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This illustrates the importance of the choice of exposure metric in epidemiological studies
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O

If these three occupational groups were part of an epidemiological study , depending on the metric used , they may or may not be part of the same similarly exposed group ( SEG )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The exposure rankings ( e.g. , low , medium , or high ) of the three groups also changes with the metric used
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

If the incorrect metric is used , significant misclassification errors may occur .

The personal sampling train for EC samples consisted of a 10 mm MSA cyclone , 37 mm pre-fired ultra pure , quartz fiber , Pallflex filter held in a 3-piece 37 mm cassette , and a MSA ELF pump

Pumps were calibrated with a Gilibrator primary flow device ( electronic bubble meter ) and operated at 3.0 LPM so that the collected mass of EC was greater than the limit of detection for the method

At this flow rate , the cyclone had a 50 % cut-point of 2.85 mm

Diesel and spark-ignition aerosols are nearly all less than 1.0 mm in diameter , and thus the cyclone collected virtually the entire aerosol mass .

Quartz fiber filters are known to adsorb organic vapors during the sampling process

A correction factor was estimated for this adsorption by using dynamic blanks

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The organic vapor passes through and adsorbs on the Pallflex filter , which is analyzed by the NIOSH 5040 method for EC
O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured

It is believed that the Pallflex filter reaches equilibrium with the adsorbed organic material thus allowing for a correction factor to be estimated

These ions attach themselves to the sampled aerosol stream with a certain probability

Surface bound PAHs have a high photoelectric ( PE ) yield , causing a high PAS response
O O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O O MeasurementDevice O

DPM found in the accumulation mode consists primarily of EC , and has a significantly lower PE yield , which results in a more moderate PAS response

SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O MeasurementDevice O

For diesel accumulation mode particles , the PAS signal correlates with the accumulation mode surface area concentration

O O O O SubstanceMeasured O O MeasurementDevice O O O O O O O O O

In mixed urban aerosols , on the other hand , where the PAH surface concentration ( for example from spark ignition engines ) may be much higher , the high PE yield of the PAH dominates the PAS response

The Twin Cities Metropolitan and the University of Minnesota transit systems together offer an environment in which both diesel and gasoline powered vehicles operate on a regular basis in various mixtures from almost all gasoline vehicles to nearly all diesel-fueled buses
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This provided a unique opportunity to measure the different exposure scenarios .
O O O O O O O O O O O O

Area and personal samples were collected depending upon the specific location and situation

Three occupational categories were selected for monitoring : bus drivers ( personal samples ) , parking garage attendants ( personal and area samples ) , and bus mechanics ( personal and area samples )

These were selected because they provided a mix of exposure scenarios based on the mix of gasoline and diesel exhaust in each scenario as well as the age of the aerosol , and they are representative of workers employed in the transportation industry

Table 1 shows the number of workshifts
O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O

For each workshift , there will be a large number of measurements gathered depending on the sampling frequency of the real-time instruments , and a single workshift average is then calculated ( shown in Table 2 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

For example , for DC , Table 1 shows that 6 workshift average measurements were obtained in bus drivers ( 3 + 2 + 1 )

For both dust and quartz , thoracic exposures exceeded respi­rable exposures

In the case of dust it was by a factor of almost three ( Table VI )

In the case of quartz , thoracic exposures ex­ceeded respirable exposures by a factor of more than 4.5
O O O O SubstanceMeasured O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O O O

It is also important to note that the regression coefficient ( R2 ) between the thoracic and respirable concentrations was less than 0.90 ( 0.83 for quartz and 0.76 for dust ) ( Table VI )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured O O O SubstanceMeasured O O O O O

An R2 of more than 0.90 has been suggested as the value indicating potential collinearity among predictors in multiple regression analysis
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Another way to state this is that the thoracic concentration is not a simple linear function of the respirable concentration or the regression coeffi­cient ( squared correlation coefficient ) would be greater than 0.90 .

For dust , the mean ratio of inhalable to respirable dust was more than 9 ( Table VI )

For quartz , on av­erage , the inhalable concentration exceeded the respirable quartz concentration by almost 26 fold ( Table VI )

The rel­atively low regression coefficients ( 0.42 for quartz and 0.48 for dust ) suggest that these are not a simple linear function of each other ( Table VI ) .

As seen in Table 2 , production from the mine varied widely

Day-to-day variability in the sampler , therefore , is to be expected

Mining operations frequently encounter equipment problems requiring maintenance and causing delays

This problem is reflected in the various down times

when no coal was being mined

Ventilation rates also varied throughout the tunnel network and from shift to shift
O O O O O O IndustryWorkplace IndustryWorkplace O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This too is responsible for some of the sample variability

The conclusions concerning total dust are the same for respirable dust , though on the average , levels are slightly lower except for return air .

The NIOSH recommended standard for nitrogen dioxide exposure contains a fifteen-minute ceiling value of 1 ppm

While the observed 8 h averages were well below this value , there is no way to determine from these measurements if the limit was exceeded during any 15 rain period

The aldehyde data in Table 7 show relatively low levels on the average

however , these may serve as an indicator of the diesel exposure .

The data in Table 8 relating other measurements show the relatively low levels of other species

The measurement of total hydrocarbons , however , was affected by the high moisture content of the mine atmosphere

Detailed size distribution and indium fuel tracer data further confirm that submicrometer mine aerosol is comprised mainly of DEA , which was effectively removed when the DDEF was installed ( 11 )

The internal standard and quantification standards used for this analysis comprise a range of PAHs , alkanes , hopanes and steranes designed to represent the range of compounds measured in ambient samples and to provide good surrogates for all of the compounds quantified in this method in the few cases when exact standards are not used

A CMB model ( EPA-CMB version 8.2 ) was used to apportion OC from motor vehicle exhaust and cigarette smoke for each of the average job type , worksite area and urban background averages listed in Table 1a and b

Three different motor vehicle exhaust sources were used in the model

diesel exhaust , spark ignition exhaust and lubricating oil impacted exhaust , which are all taken from the same fleet study

The diesel profile is a weighted average of all weight class and driving cycle diesel exhaust based on the age of the fleet in the LA area ( Lough and Schauer , 2007 )

The lubricating oil-impacted exhaust is taken from a " white smoker , " or normal-smoking gasoline vehicle , which has elevated lubricating oil markers ( hopanes and steranes ) , but not elevated PAH or EC

Smoking vehicles are often identified based on a visible smoke plume , which in the case of the ‘‘white smokers’’ are often a result of burning lubricating oil , which is possible with both gasoline and diesel vehicles

Cigarette smoke apportionment has been performed using iso- and anteiso-alkanes as unique tracers , but in this tsudy , normal alkanes are considered indicators of cigarette smoke , using a previously published source profile

This helps to determine the importance of worksite area or personal activity in the personal exposure samples , and whether each job type and each area type has a unique exposure profile

In Figure 2a and b , the OC , EC and organic tracer concentrations for the personal exposure and worksite averages have been normalized by the urban background concentration ( i.e. , the personal exposure and worksite area concentrations have been divided by the urban background average )

This effectively demonstrates the impact or enhancement due to the worksite area or job type , whereas a normalized concentration of 1 indicates that the personal exposure and the worksite area concentrations are on the same level as the urban background .

The availability of this database and its suitability to provide historical information and variation in background particulate air pollution were reviewed
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Since climatic factors such as temperature , precipitation , and wind direction can strongly influence exposure , the availability of current and historical meteorologic information from the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration ( NOAA ) National Climate Data Center ( http : //www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ ) also was assessed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT
O O
O O

One of the key challenges to exposure assessment is the choice of exposure markers
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

In this study our goal was to identify a marker that not only represents exposure to diesel exhaust , but also serves as an index of carcinogens in diesel exhaust , ( ie , quantitatively related to the cancer risk )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O SubstanceMeasured SubstanceMeasured O O O O O O O O O O O

This second dimension is important because all compounds in diesel emissions are probably not carcinogenic and the carcinogenicity of the total particle may correlate poorly with the carcinogenic fraction .
