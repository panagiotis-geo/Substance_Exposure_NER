Analysis of 1-NP
There were 18 personal and 44 area sample sets , all approximately eight hours in duration
Since climatic factors such as temperature , precipitation , and wind direction can strongly influence exposure , the availability of current and historical meteorologic information from the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration ( NOAA ) National Climate Data Center ( http : //www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ ) also was assessed .
A statistically significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) was observed between these medians for all the detected PACs , except for dibenz [ a , h ] -anthracene ( DB [ a , h ] A ) , dibenzo [ a , l ] pyrene ( DB [ a , l ] P ) , dibenzo [ a , e ] pyrene ( DB [ a , e ] P ) and dibenzo [ a , i ] pyrene ( DB [ a , i ] P )

For most analyses the number of cigarettes smoked during the study day up to the time of urine collection was used , since it was felt to better reflect markers present in the urine at the end of the shift than the number of cigarettes smoked only during the shift .
The highest value obtained was thus 25 times lower than the lowest recommended exposure limit of 100 µg/m3 proposed for an 8 hr/da- 40 hr/week exposure. [ Daily PNC measured at both sites ranged from 16,544 to more than 67,000 particles/cm3 ( AM = 36,381 particles/cm3
Dust concentrations are calculated from measurements made during the cutting cycles and not the time between cuts , and are normalised to a standard 10 mm cut depth
Multivariate ANOVA models were then created using a forward selection method , beginning with the variable with the lowest p-value and adding variables until further additions did not result in statistically significant p-values for the added variable or earlier variables lost statistical significance
Sampling locations located in the following areas of concern varied slightly between stations because of particular station characteristics :
In some cases it was decided not to continue sampling for the full work task , to avoid overloading the high-flow sampler filters .
All of the surface and underground workers who participated in the pilot study were asked to carry personal air sampling equipment during two shifts in the same working week

All of the tools were designed to cut wet , primarily to limit wear on the expensive diamond cutting blade
locomotives may be added to the middle or rear of the train
The method for sampling and determination of PAHs is described in detail elsewhere .
The cleaner operators in Plant A had the highest GM exposure to respirable dust ( 1.3 mg m−3 ) and total dust ( 21 mg m−3 )
The slabs were placed in an open container of approximately 15 m2 , located in a hall of 30 x 25 m and a height of 5.5 m
Doors of the hall were kept close during the experiments
Although it is common to use the geometric mean ( GM ) and geometric standard deviation ( GSD ) to describe lognormal exposure distributions , for epide­miologic purposes it is often desirable to estimate the mean ex­posure of an exposure group
( a ) For a continuous variable , the logarithm-response , i.e. , the logarithm of respirable quartz exposure , will increase by beta units per unit change of the regressor variable ( determinant ) , or , for the back transformed response , the response , i.e

this follows the trends seen in Figure 2a and b where the EC is at most enriched three times over the urban background , whereas hopanes are enriched up to 10 times over the urban background
Such figures , however , fall mainly in the range 10-20 pg/g , which is much weaker than the 100-300 pg/g common in coal smoke .
Pulmonary function
The efficiency of the control measures on lung function was assessed by quotients of lung function variables , “filter/no filter , ” noted F/NF in the Table 11
Dockworkers load and unload cargo in the docks , usually using forklifts , whereas hostlers drive small tractors in the yard to move trailers to and from the freight dock

The difference between the personal and area sampler can be explained by the much higher volume of air that passed through the area sampler , giving more contact with the sulfur dioxide gas
The workers provided information about type and duration of tasks performed during sampling by filling out a plant- and department-specific form
The flow is not constant and the initial flows of 2 or 1 l min-1 result in waste of water without any improvement in dust suppression .

For example , a driver will not stay neatly within a given radius of a terminal but will likely exit this radius and drive in one general direction
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) Analytical Method 5040 for Elemental Carbon ( Diesel Particulate ) requires an open-faced quartz fiber filter ( QFF ) and
For the mechanics , one of the terminals had very high exposures in cold weather , reportedly because the shop was “very closed up , ” which would trap any exhaust emissions

Workers mixed silica sand with binders manually to prepare the mold and cores or collected scrap metal for melting in the furnace at 700–1200 °C before casting
However , the three control systems generally reduced respirable dust levels to less than one tenth
Methods
Although the explanation behind this difference remains unclear , it may be attributable in part to differences in traffic composition between interstate ( LH ) and intercity ( P & D ) driving , as well as to increased idling time for LH drivers

Compared with larger particles , the number of UFPs ( < 100 nm ) is generally large
Similarly , the aim was to examine the distribution of pollutants for one representative day in each garage rather than to determine long term mean values
To summarize , the risk factors we used as criteria to evaluate exposure are :
Since area and helper exposures are similar to the operator’s exposure , the primary exposure may be due to a buildup of respirable aerosol within the enclosed space , rather than direct exposure to slurry spray
The GM of all the measurement of TD was 1.26 mg/m3 ranging from minimum 0.08 mg/m3 when installing material of iron to maximum 8.40 mg/m3 when stiffening of beams

Based on the combined information from the CO2 and temperature analysis , a cutoff point for open-shut windows at 750 ppm was approximated , with values below given the label \" open \" and values above given the label \" shut \" Because this analysis was based on data from integrated samplers ( session averages and not real-time data ) when windows were partially open or closed during a session , a dichotomous variable ( open/shut ) would not accurately represent the relationship between window status and exposure
Worker exposure to airborne respirable dust and RCS was measured during the time on site and generated a further input to the baseline survey

Combine harvesting of cereals is a source of dust with similar percentages of both fractions , the organic component being dominant
At the end of each work shift , stored data were downloaded to a personal computer for evaluation .
Overall , 41 643 workers were estimated as potentially at-risk of exposure to RCS in the selected industrial sectors between 1996 and 2012
Control of emission at source ( by engineered controls ) is recognised as the most effective measure , but in some circumstances is not practicable , and the use of RPE is necessary to maintain exposure at a safe level
Mutagenicity -S9 also failed to demonstrate a dose-response relationship with diesel exposure strata
Preliminary determinations of the number of area samples required to detect a reduction of 50 percent or more in concentrations of Ce were made using levels found in a previous HHE

The total volatile organic compounds ( tvoc ) average background concentration obtained outside all fire stations was 0.5 ppm ( range : < 0.1 to 3.6 ppm )
The changes in mean exposures in the mechanics and road drivers by weather were undoubtedly responsible for the signifi­cant interaction term in the ANOVA .
Sputum processing
The same sampling techniques were used to collect background samples in various nonrailroad locations throughout the United States including a national park , a beach , and major city locations
The views and professional opinion of the visiting occupational hygienist were therefore captured in a structured way that allowed an objective assessment of competence to be made
On-site tests provide realistic data but they are susceptible to variation as a result of external forces such as wind speed and direction , which are outside the control of the experimenter
Several tests were performed to assess the degree of comparability between the experimental and control groups
Five pairs of duplicates that were analyzed had coefficients of variation ranging from 4 to 33 percent , with an average of 18 percent for the numbers of fibers detected per sample .

The carbon composition of fine particles ( PM2.5 ) from traffic exhausts may play a role in adverse health effects
The standard process was undertaken for all appliances housed in the engine bay
Each port terminal has a gate , or checkpoint , where incoming and outgoing truck traffic is controlled
Together with the 10 Hr engine bay continuous samplers , a number of instantaneous measurements and active sampling techniques were applied for the activities as listed in table 2.7 below .
Although crystalline silica has several polymorphs such as cristobalite and tridymite , it is reasonable to use quartz as the standard because the other forms of silica are usually not present in a significant amount in industrial hygiene samples .
its response has also been shown to be proportional to the EC content of diesel particulates and also correlates well with the bacterial genotoxicity of air-particle extracts .
The quartz limit of detection was 5.5μg .
The association between the average measured and estimated exposure levels for all jobs combined ( Figure 2 ) was similar to that seen in another comparison exercise that we had undertaken ( Cherrie and Schneider 1999 )
most seemed to originate from asphalt fumes
It was hypothesized that the correlation between indoor and outdoor temperatures would be maximized when the window was open , and CO2 levels would be highest when the window was closed
The final model to predict the OC exposure level included smoking , Euro engine standard , job task and truck payload capacity ( adjusted R2 = 0.470 , p < 0.001 ) .
Methods
The real-time measurement TWAs for PM 2.5 ranged from 27 to 240 μg/m3 with a mean of 62 μg/m3
These results are summarised in Fig
This procedure was repeated 8-10 times , reportedly separating the dust into two portions-one less than 5 mm and the other greater
However , if there was no monitoring station near the collection site , then the data from the closest station were used for the background values .
Calculations
In any study using these data , the union membership of these workers could be verified by a more detailed search of each company’s personnel records .
The plan was to obtainPEM measurements of average PM2.5 concurrently with the DustTrak measurements and to use the PEM value as a 1-point calibration to set the scale for the responses
Roughly 4 % of the underground workers in diesel-use mines showed mild restrictive lung problems , the corresponding prevalence for the matched controls being around 2 %

The  first site visit was conducted before the ceramic filters were installed on the engines , and a post-control evaluation was conducted four months late
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For respirable dust exposures only the presence of a cab was associated with decreased exposures
Eight-hour time-weighted average ( TWA ) results ranged from 18 to 116 times above the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit ( PEL ) with silica content ranging from 1.4 to 23 percent
The results suggest that in-cab particle exposures are positively related to smoking , ambient particle concentrations , truck age , and open windows , with other significant modifying factors such as weather
Com­plete details of the mine layout , mining method , pro­duction tonnage , and ventilation for each mine are avail­ able from MSHA ( 75 ) .
The conclusions concerning total dust are the same for respirable dust , though on the average , levels are slightly lower except for return air .
The spread of the results obtained resulted from a non-uniform morphology of the collected samples of settled dust , which , in turn , is associated with the heterogeneous character of dust , both in airborne and settled phases
About one-third of the measurements over the exposure limit were at the work sites using silica substitutes at the time of the assessment
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Firefighter exposure to diesel exhaust was evaluated in ten fire stations : four in New York City , two in Boston and four in Los Angeles , All fire stations studied were two- or three- story buildings , with the exception of one single-story station in Boston
For a limited number of heavily loaded samples ( 11 samples ) , the interior surfaces of the sampling cassette was rinsed with double distilled/deionized water to ensure that all of the dust was removed and placed in a metallic weighting container
ABSTRACT
Gravimetric measurement of aerosol mass
Respirable dust and quartz concentrations were evaluated against reference values of 2 mg m−3 for respirable dust and 100 μg m−3 ( South African Occupational Exposure Limit ) , 50 μg m−3 [ National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Recommended Exposure Limit ( REL ) ] , and 25 μg m−3 ( American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value ) for respirable quartz
Official leakage value was lower than 0.1 %
respirable quartz exposure , will change by per unit change of the regressor variable of concern .
As expected , the RD and RCS concentrations are lower in wet conditions even without any kind of suppression
None of the quartz mass concentration ratio data collected for the GK2.69 comparison to the SIMPEDS could be used because the values were less than the LOD ( n =6 ) or were outliers ( < 0.3 [ n =12 ] or > 3.0 [ n =1 ] ) and so were not included in data analysis .
The covariate years employed in the same job was not included in the model due to high correlation ( > 0.8 ) with the covariate age

ABSTRACT
The direct reading measurements and the passive dosimeter measurements that were either recorded as zero or were collected for less than 120 min were discarded
Given the large percentages for non-detects , the calculation of the standard normal and lognormal descriptive statistics was not possible for many substances
Measurements were carried out on one bitumen plant , three asphalt production plants , two asphalt stripper sites , and 14 asphalt paving sites
Tables 6 through 10 report the results of measurements in each industry , and Table 11 summarizes the results across industries
GMs for EC in FLT samples were ∼10–70 % higher than the background levels at most locations except depots 5 and 6 , where FLT and background levels were similar
exhaust ventilation mounted on the equipment , might be necessary for a further reduction of exposure
The material to be cut ( H ) is mounted on top of the inner frame
On this occasion at none of the garage sites was there substantially less smoke than outside
Average daily wind speed was estimated throughout the sampling period via the port 's nearest on-site meteorological station , and the number of trucks crossing the gates was obtained throughout the sampling period using available data collected by the port , as a part of the regular management of port activities
Ethics
The large majority of them were willing to participate in the study
dry grit-blasting buildings or cutting out mortar without effective on-tool extraction ) exposures can greatly exceed WELs .
These comparisons ( Table VIII ) show substantial reduction in the number of samples above the exposure limit for baggers , laborers , and drill operators and modest reduction for stone crushing workers .
One has to look at the sample statistics to determine the best estimate of the true 95th percentile , which for NO2 is 0.22 ppm using non-parametric methods , and 0.25 ppm using the lognormal distribution assumption ( Table IV )
One sampler was placed approximately 1.5 km downwind at a height of approximately 2 m
Gate controllers were exposed to concentrations of contaminants associated with diesel engine exhaust ( elemental carbon GM=1.6μg/m3
Samples of airborne particulate matter ( ‘particles’ ) were collected on the surface and underground at fixed sampling locations
Diesel exhaust exposure was mea- sured over the work shift by constant-flow personal sampling pumps
If the data were censored , i.e. , contained one or more non- detects , the sample size used to calculate each confidence limit was the total sample size minus the number of non-detects. ( 14 ) There is no generally accepted method for calculating confidence intervals where the data set is censored
Similar patterns were seen for other historical time periods
Only pre-cleaned quartz microfibre filters ( Whatman QMA , Ø 37 mm , 2.2-lm pore size ) were used
A group with a ratio .2 is often considered to be uniformly exposed .
When we excluded leaf pulling we found a stronger correlation between respirable dust levels and soil clay content ( mg/m3 respirable dust = 0.014 [ % clay in the soil ] −0.045 , R2 = 0.51 , p = 0.048 )
Most of the personal samples were more concentrated than the am­bient samples
The predictive capabilities of this model and its error structure can be assessed with calibration and validation data collected at the same time
Relationship between elemental and organic carbon
The GM exposure for total dust was 79 % higher among workers using respirators all the time , and 65 % higher among workers using respirators some of the time compared to workers not using respirators
Complementary information concerning type of minerals mined or used in the production processes was collected at enrolment and later when new companies and sites entered the programme
These trends may have been caused by a number of factors , such as increased levels of ambient pollutant levels during the summer months or decreased suspension of soil particles ( which contain a high proportion of organic carbon ) in winter because of the frozen ground
During each of eight runs ( two at each concentration level ) , simultaneous sampling for total weight of particulate matter , elemental carbon , and organic carbon was conducted
Sampling strategy and job groups
Three controllers work in rotation at the gate over the course of the day so that there are two controllers at the gate at all times

Dynamic spirometry gave values for forced vital capacity ( FVC , liters )
Information on potential determinants within each job group was obtained from three sources : 1 ) the workers themselves , 2 ) the industrial hygienist responsible for the sampling , and 3 ) the job site superintendent
This allows the reduction in concentration to be estimated along with an adjustment of the ta to allow for variation in the plume trajectory because of changes in wind direction
Based on these assumptions , temperature and CO2 for P & D nonsmoking drivers ( smoking would have artificially inflated CO2 levels in the cab ) were analyzed .
An 8 litre capacity tank should be capable of supplying water at a flow rate of 0.5 l min-1 for 16 min
