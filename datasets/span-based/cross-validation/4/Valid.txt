The measurements were obtained following the instructions provided by Dräger
No Ce was detected on the other 18 samples .
Respirable quartz concentration data was best described by a log normal distribution and all potential determinants were tested against the logarithm of the quartz concentrations , due to the skewness of the distribution
It was sampled only for the limited time that the continuous miner was operating .
Three further parameters are incorporated into the basic model : the fractional time the source is active ( ta ) , the efficiency of any personal ( respiratory ) protection worn by the subject ( nppe ) , and the gravimetric dispersion of the emissions from the source ( dgv )
The data w’ere tested for normality using graphical techniques’7’ and found to be approximately lognormallv distributed
Trace concentrations of Ce were detected on 4 of 16 area samples collected in the bay during the four-day sampling campaign

Data Analysis
For testing compliance with the Occupational Exposure limit value ( OELV ) the joint document by the British and Dutch occupational hygiene societies ( BOHS and NVvA ) on ‘Testing Compliance with Occupational Exposure Limits ( OELs ) for Airborne Substances’ ( BOHS , 2011 ) was followed
To accurately assess the impact of PM emission sources , particularly motor vehicle exhaust , and organic elemental carbon ( OCEC ) analysis and nonpolar organic molecular marker analyis by thermal deosrption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( TD-GCMS ) were conducted on all of the PM samples
The quartz exposures were generally low and < 1 % of the samples exceeded the OEL of 100 μg m−3 ( The Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority , 2007 )
However , the composition between L # 1 and the other samples remained rela­tively constant .
The determinations of the level of free silica in the ash - residues after the combustion of settled dust - were performed 3 times for each ash sample
The values presented are the maximum levels measured over a time period in a particular sampling location
The predicted values were then plotted against the measured value at the second position .
A full study would be necessary for sufficient characterization of this statistical variability .
Background levels can be determined by assessment of terminal location ( urban versus rural and region of the country )
In general , the VOC , simple inorganic compounds and PAH values were many hundreds of times less than the LOC and were similar to the external environmental values obtained
The larger GSD values indicate increasingly skewed distributions , whereas values below 1.4 are nearly symmetric and are indistinguishable from normal distributions

Every sample was classified according to the type of sample ( personal or area ) , location ( turnaround , heavy repairs , on board locomotive ) , by various trades and ventilation situation
In addition , because the crew members rarely left their stations it was felt that area samples would be quite representative of their personal exposures

Determinants of exposure
Compliance inspection data that were taken from the OSHA Integrated Management Information System ( IMIS ) for 1988–2003 ( n = 7,209 ) were used to measure the airborne crystalline silica dust exposure levels among U.S
Because the working conditions and work practices adopted by the Latvian railway drivers were very similar to those of the Russian cohort , the exposures to diesel exhaust particles can reasonably be assumed to be similar in magnitude .
A personal air sampling pump ( AirChek 52 , SKC Inc. , Eighty Four , PA , USA ) was set to an air flow rate of 2.5 L/min and linked to a 25 mm aluminum cyclone assembly ( SKC225-01-01 , SKC Inc. , Eighty Four , PA , USA ) with a 25 mm filter cassette that contained a glass microfiber filter coating with a polytetrafluoroethylene filter ( T60A20 , PALL Life Sciences , Westborough , MA , USA ) for collecting air samples

There were statistically significant differences in the total number of cells.mL-1 of sputum between miners and controls .
The sampling and analytic methods used to obtain these data are unclear , and the measured values seem too low to be simple measurements of total respirable dust
To estimate changes to the elemental carbon concentration , the values for the number of other sources ( 0 or 1 , more than one ) and for the distance from the source to the sampling media ( < = 10 feet , > 10 feet and < = 20 feet , > 20 feet ) were entered into the model
Use of medians for exposure variables ( Table 2 ) adjusts for the skewness commonly seen in the distribution of airborne exposures , which was also present in our data .
For example , there were four benzene results listed as detects when it was known that no detects for benzene had been measured by CSXT during the 1990 to 2011 interval

The distinctions between the P & D drivers , the dock-workers , and the P & D/dockworkers were less clear
Since crystalline silica in the form of quartz is a major component of concrete , airborne respirable quartz dust may be produced during construction work involving the disturbance of concrete , thereby producing a silicosis hazard for exposed workers

However , for site and job , adjusted temporal trends estimated for the recently enrolled sites ( between 2010 and 2016 ) suggested an increase in exposure levels by +1.6 % and +5.6 % per sampling campaign for respirable dust and respirable quartz , respectively
These differences are not considered to affect the results , because there is no correlation between mitigation of lung irritation and air contaminants after filtering .

The system consisted of the grinder ( equipped with a ventilated shroud ) , a length of flexible corrugated hose , and a portable electric vacuum cleaner that acted as the fan and dust collector for the ventilation system ( see Figures 1 and 2 )
However , the evidence remains suggestive of a regional component to driver exposures that must be accounted for in a prediction model .
Oxides of nitrogen samples collected on day 1 were not valid and , therefore , were not reported
Consequently , not all of the workers were exposed to diesel exhaust
The number of non-detectable assessments , where sample analysis fell below the detection limit ( DL ) of the method , are also reported in Table II

ABSTRACT
Some states and cities had monitoring data as early as the late 1960s , and this information was included in AIRS
In addition , parallel samples of EC , OC and CO2 were collected at a second position within the depot , mostly in the keg storage area , where FLTs were also in frequent use .
As the identities of the plants where the impinger samples were taken were not known , these samples could not be used to directly estimate quartz exposures for the 18 plants in the cohort study
Since the use of control measures was only slightly increased for demolishers and even slightly decreased for tuck pointers in the intervention group during follow-up ( both not statistically significant ) , it is not likely that the change in exposure in these groups was caused by an increased use of control measures among these two job categories .
Access to the farms was granted as the researcher knew the farmers
As can easily be seen , maximum concentrations of NO2 and respirable and total dust existed at the face and in the return airway .
The measurements were performed over a relatively long time period
No difference was found for the three campaigns in the case of short time maximum exposure and therefore only the combined data are given in Table 15 as well .
