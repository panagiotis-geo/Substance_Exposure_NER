The criteria for a successful maneuver required that the difference between expiratory and inspiratory vital capacity did not exceed 10 %
Several indicators have been proposed as surrogates for estimating exposures to diesel exhaust but very few studies have focused specifically on monitoring the ultrafine fraction through the measurement of particle number concentrations
After incorporating the protection factors offered by the single-use dust masks and disposable HEPA half masks worn at the time of sample collection , 29 percent ( 10 ) of the workers still had exposures exceeding 0.05 mg/m3 and 17 percent ( 6 ) remained above 0.10 mg/m3 .

It is likely that volatile OC adsorbed to the undenuded personal exposure sampler , causing it to be biased high
This suggests that the latter two job groups are exposed to a higher proportion of organics adsorbed onto the carbon particles than the fork-lift trucks category
At each mine , bulk and personal respirable dust samples were collected at scheduled areas
The limits of detection for quartz and cristobalite on filters were 0.01 and 0.02 mg , respectively
The measurements were only carried out on indoor work tasks because of the outdoor measurement-uncertainties due to changing wind conditions
This is used as a rough split to separate groups that have less variability by sample , which would mean less impact by date , time or personal activity

Dust exposure and pneumoconiosis were investigated in a South African pottery that manufactured wall tiles and bathroom fittings
This could be due to a concentration of quartz in the smaller , respirable-size particles .
If a large number of samples are collected under a wide variety of conditions , there are likely to be other subtler differences associated with characteristics of the expo- sure situations .
One plant is located in central Norway , while the two other plants are located in the southern part of Norway

The samples which did not contain sufficient dust weight to proceed with the silica analysis are not reported in Table 3 .
Again , this can be seen by comparing the GSDs of the exposure distributions for the three groups
Inhalable exposures greatly exceeded respirable exposures for both dust and quartz
A logistic fit to the data shows that the trend is not significantly different from the zero line .
Area samples were collected from turnaround and heavy repair areas
A calibration curve was established for each composition that ranged from 0.03–5.16 mg/sample for quartz , 0.03–4.56 mg/sample for cristobalite , and 0.041–2.49 mg/sample for tridymite
