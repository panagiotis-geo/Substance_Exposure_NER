There were no significant differences in nitrogen dioxide level between the lorry drivers from the six companies ( result not shown ) .
Similarly , the airborne concentration of nitrogen dioxide was at or below the LOD ( ≤ 0.5 ppm ) for the all activities , except the 33 minute start of shift checks at Loganlea Fire Station ( 0.75 ppm ) , which was ca
ABSTRACT
Approximately 32 000 personal exposure measurements were collected during 29 sampling campaigns during a 15-year period ( 2002–2016 )

General outdoor background air pollution , including but not limited to PM2.5 , can be quantified on the basis of data from the AIRS database
Since the arithmetic mean of the daily exposures is given by
The contribution from traffic generates smaller particles , as reported from measurements in street canyons
In-cab particle exposures for drivers assigned to both short and long distance trips were observed , as well as information on the smoking status of the driver , truck characteristics such as age and model , and weather conditions during the sampling session
mean daily temperature 11–18 C )
To standardise the influence of working environment , the layout of the building under construction is described by a number of descriptors : glass already present in the windows ( 0/1 ) , presence of other workers causing extra exposure ( 0/1 ) , weather conditions ( rain ( 0/1 ) , wind ( 0/1 ) )
They provided convincing evidence of a respirable quartz risk on sandy soil farms but scant evidence of associated disease
however , miners working in the auto shop were the most heavily exposed
Crystalline silica was determined by standard methods modified for quartz due to the presence of graphite in the furnace hall ( Bye , 1983
The background level was applied to adjust for the effects of ambient levels
The results of the survey demonstrate that exposure to elemental carbon varies considerably among mining occupational groups
Sampling for respirable crystalline silica was conducted as specified in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health analytical method 7500 ( Silica , Crystalline , by X-Ray Diffraction )
The OSHA PEL takes into account the percentage of respirable silica in each sample , reducing the allowable respirable dust PEL accordingly
In the 1974-1995 period , the geometric mean for bagging operator was 60.2 µg/m3 but this had been reduced to 44.6 µg/m3 by 1998-2002 .
Pre-weighing was performed in this laboratory
Both sampling and gravimetric analysis were carried out by Eurofins Miljø A/S
Samples below the analytical LOD of quartz were assigned a value of two thirds of the detection limit
A limited number of side-by-side personal samples were also collected by equipping a worker with two personal samplers to assess the relationship between EC and RCD measurements for personal sampling .
The hexagonal α-SiC is the main product , while the cubic β-SiC is formed at lower temperatures and is used in the metallurgic industry or recycled into the furnace mix
Other pairs of high- and low-flow-rate samplers were placed as near to the worker as physically possible by placing the samplers at 1.5 m using a tripod
The ANOVA for this dependent variable ( C , ) again indicated that job ( p < 0.0001 ) , weather ( p = 0.003 ) , and interaction ( job * weather ) terms ( p < 0,0001 ) were all highly significant .
In Table II , personal samples are summarized , and in Table III , area samples are shown
Total bacteria and fungi were represented morphologically by 51.3 % cocci , 44.3 % bacilli , and 4.4 % spores
The geometric mean exposure of the shotcreters after tunnel breakthrough was 78 percent lower for total dust compared to that before breakthrough ( p < 0.01 ) , but no significant difference was found for respirable dust
that is , greater than 5 % of the exposures exceeded the OEL
Regression parameter estimates ( denoted by beta in Table 3 ) are interpreted differently for the four cases , according to the following general rules :
Fig
In approximately 8 % of all samples , there were extended work shifts ( e.g. , 10 to 12 hours )
However this does not address the residual need which has to be acknowledged , e.g
Cyclones were loaded with either a polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) or heat-treated filter for RCS and REC measurements , respectively
No such relationship was found for the EC and BC data
( This analysis was repeated for TC levels in the lead and trailing locomotives
More experienced operators relied on the track guides , and tended to stay out of the spray plume .
To ensure that the exposure level was effectively measured , an attempt was made to sample for at least 7–8 h
Quartz analysis was done using a micropellet technique ( 5 mm ) and an FTIR spectrophotometer
Distribution by industrial sector is shown in Table 1 and distribution by occupational group is provided in Table 2 .
Logarithms of the measured values were therefore used for further analyses
At a flow rate of 1.7 L/min , the respirable particulate which passes through the impactor inlet is separated into two fractions
A non-parametric one-way analysis of variance using the Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to detect and identify variables influencing the exposure level and only variables statistically significant at the P < 0.05 were included in the model
Personals vs backgrounds
We determined that the DustTrak is more useful as an indicator of changes over time than as an indicator of the absolute PM2.5 levels in this setting .
Based on visual observation of ready-mix plants visited during this study , the dustiest area was the loading point as the cement ingredient was being added
Operations with the highest mean organic carbon exposures were installation of drop ceilings and wall tiles , pipejacking , and laving conduit/pile in trenches ( Table VII ) .
For the most recent years ( 2012–2016 ) , decreasing temporal trends were apparent again for both respirable dust and quartz of −7.1 % and −8.7 % per campaign , respectively
Analytical Methods
however , to guarantee comparability with respect to the real workplace situation of the miners involved .
After nine cuts the linear module , saw , logger and sampling pump were switched off
Particles were measured with a logging instrument , Data-RAM ( MIE pDR1000 ) , using nephelometric monitoring
Possibly quartz exposures did decrease over time for these jobs , but the decrease was just not reflected by historical sampling
Exposure measurements were carried out .
0.004 ppm

The measurements were made after identification of the most relevant work tasks , included measurements for each work task
Figure 4 ( b ) shows similar data as it relates to persistent phlegm production
Concentrations of 1-NP in the breathing zones were also higher than at fixed sites ( 2.5-fold in the coal mine and 10-fold in the oil shale mine )
Evaluation of Proposed Exposure Reconstruction Method
Measurements of respirable particulate and NO2 were made on each worker and collected on the same day as the pulmonary function tests and questionnaires
RESULTS
Therefore , movement between terminals is limited once workers are hired , and job categories tend to remain stable throughout each worker’s employment tenure .
Area samples were collected at areas with the highest visible dust , which was generally below the loading point for the cement component
The limit of detection is about 2 ug/filter , which translates to a concentration of about 1 ug/m3 , assuming a 2 m3 air volume
A quasi-experimental study design was developed to examine the acute effects of occupational exposure to diesel emissions in white male underground coal miners during an 8-h work shift
The respirable dust exposure levels are shown in Fig

Exposure to silica dust occurs in many occupations , including construction
Most of the workers ( 77 % ) were monitored on more than one occasion .
Although there were differences , none was statistically significant ( p > 0.1 )
Six or seven clays were used
The tunnel was 3 km long at the time of the study
Mine-specific mean and geometric mean values for mines with more than 10 samples show that mean exposure was above 100 µg/m3 for 2 mines , was between 50 µg/m3 and 100 µg/m3 for 29 mines , and was < 50 µg/m3 for the remaining 88 mines
Observation of water spray-controlled versus uncontrolled crystalline silica clearly demonstrates a significant reduction in dust production
In addition to detector tube samples , full shift personal samples ( NO2 and respirable dust ) were collected from miners at each mine site
Therefore , there was less incentive to reduce exposures for workers in these jobs
Chemical analysis
Exhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) ( geometric mean±sem ) was higher in the underground workers than in the references ( 8.4+-1.09 versus 5.6+-1.07 parts per billion ( ppb ) , p=0.001 ) , whereas spirometric values were comparable

Limitations
Centerline velocity was measured using a TSI Velocicalc Plus model 8386 multiparameter ventilation meter .
The particle size distribution , based on data from the EEPS , confirms that the large majority of DE particles are on the nanometric scale since more than 99 % of particles measured were smaller than 100 nm and that the main particle size fraction was between 20-40nm .
Results are expressed as milligrams per cubic meter of air ( mg/m3 )
P-Trak has a lower cutoff diameter at 20 nm , i.e. , the smallest particles in the ultrafine range will be too small to be detected

Assuming no sources are in the far field , then there would be no far-field component of exposure level ( that is , )
Dockworkers and dock , shop and yard area samples have standard deviations nearly 20 % of the average , which would indicate consistent OC concentrations within a group , but not necessarily identical OC source contributions
Six coal mines utilizing diesel units underground were included in this study
Organic carbon ( OC ) and EC concentrations were determined in the respirable fraction of the dust
The values shown in columns 3 and 4 for carbon monoxide and nitric oxide levels appear to exceed the OSHA standards , but this is not the case since the contaminants’ concentration reached these levels for periods of only 20 and 30 minutes respectively while the trains were in a tunnel .
Average concentrations at all sampled locations are shown in Table 2 .

Exposure ratings of 0 to 4 are assigned using the rating scheme of the AIHA. ( 14 ) For example , an exposure rating of Category 3 or less indicates that the majority of the occupational exposures—that is , at least 95 % —were less than the OEL
As might be expected , a wide variation was found both from job to job and from railroad to railroad within a given job because these values reflect the influence of different individual smoking patterns and variable environmental conditions
From this group , only nonsmokers ( n=29 ) were invited to participate in the study
These data should be interpreted with caution because as the number of samples decreases so does the relevance of the measure and the stability of the mean and of the percent of samples greater than 150 .
When measurements exceeded the OEL , between 79 and 100 % of the workers had used respirators some or all of the time depending on component
• plant treatment : chemical spraying of crops , treatment of seed-grain ;
In short , measurements with extreme concentrations ( > 100 mg/m3 for respirable dust and > 10 mg/m3 for respirable quartz ) , most likely due to measurement procedure errors , tampering with samples or extreme conditions were considered outliers and excluded
As seen in Table I , these samples also contained the highest amount of ETS , and the ETS particles contain a large fraction ( 61 % ) of extractable material ( Table II )
The exposure ratings provide an alternative means for assessing compliance with an OEL

Nitro-PAHs were reduced using sodium hydrosulphide hydrate ( Fluka , Buchs , Germany )
however , this may simply be due to changes in intensity for PM concentrations at all locations primarily due to meteorology .
During the course of this study , sampling equipment was worn by fire-fighters an average of 6.5 hr per shift
Respirable dust was collected using the HSE MDHS 14/3 method ( HSE , 2000 )
Eight ( 67 % ) of the subjects described themselves as white , two ( 17 % ) as Hispanic , and one each as Asian and other
Fifteen personal sam­ ples were collected , representing shifts for 2 bolters , 4 jammers , 2 shifters , and 7 truck drivers
and ( Firm effect ) and ( Error ) are statistically independent .
On day 3 , the truck made no runs , and the medic engine made three runs
In this case , samples were taken during various activities : explosion and rubble removal by digger-filled dumpers , limestone face cleaning , and concrete sqraying to secure the arch .
Thus , the fan may have had an impact on reducing the operator 's exposure to respirable sized particles
For this study , the majority of the jobs selected lasted a full shift , so that a long cutting period could be sampled , in order to assure that the collected sample would exceed the detection limit of the method
A flow rate of approximately 2 L/min was maintained , and the samples were collected for the entire work period except for time spent away from the locomotives at the beginning and end of the shift
Two types of analyses were performed to test the effects of diesel emissions on the ventilatory function of coal miners .
All identifiers were removed before we obtained these data .
The DustTrak has a data logging feature , which allows the user to collect specific information regarding sampling duration and average , minimum , and maximum aerosol concentrations
injection workers , shotcreting operators , and shaft drillers
Each subgroup follows the overall trend in that the diesel-exposed individuals had ( on average ) a lower FEV1 than their matched counterparts
The percent quartz content of a sample may be computed by dividing the quartz mass by the gravimetric mass .
The pump was turned off during breaks , at lunch time , and when the worker left the area or performed a task other than grinding .
These depots suffered from a combination of intensive FLT usage and architecture which impeded natural ventilation
Clinical findings and symptoms
Underground Mining
The results demonstrate that the elemental carbon method is suitable for the railroad environment and the respirable combustible dust method is not
For this reason , future sampling efforts will include more GPS tracking units and real-time particle exposure monitors in the vehicle samples , and traffic information will be solicited from drivers immediately following their return to the terminal
The major benefits of using the DustTrak were that it allowed us to measure short duration high-exposure tasks with reasonable accuracy and permitted evaluation of changes in working conditions instantaneously
When the results were compared with individually calculated OSHA PELs [ PEL 5 10/ ( % SiO2 + 2 ) ] , 16 % of the samples exceeded the PEL assuming no exposure , and 22 % exceeded the PEL assuming uniform exposure .

The geometric mean minus and plus one geometric standard deviation were 10.2 µ/m3 and 72.4 µg/m3 , respectively
The following instruments have been applied ( Table 2 ) .
The set of results in table 2a does not fit the observation that the crystalline silica content of the dust is usually lower than in the material being cut and this is unexplained
For drill operators , 15.7 % of samples for rotary ( air ) drill operators exceeded the exposure limit as did 11.0 % of samples for rotary drill operators ( Table VIII )

Occupational Exposure to Diesel Exhaust Fumes
Together with the 10 Hr engine bay continuous samplers , a number of instantaneous measurements and active sampling techniques were applied for the activities as listed in table 2.6 below .
Three samplers for DPM and three CO dositubes were located in each of the units , one on the engineer’s console , one on the conductors console , and one on the firewall at the back of the cab
A random intercept for subject was included to adjust for correlations between repeated measures on the same worker
The relationship between sampling methods was investigated using simple least squares linear regression methods with the fitted line forced through the origin

Even though the data sets are small , it is encouraging to note the consistency of the measures within each location
The peaks observed during the second stage are reported and quantitated as elemental carbon ( Cc )
However , six miners were excluded from all analyses due to the inability to produce sputum of sufficient quality for the cell analyses , and one was unable to complete both investigations
The within- and between-worker variances were considered to be random effects
( Fig
For EC and OC , we additionally included a fixed effect for current smoking status of the subject , as smoking was allowed during breaks at the workplace and influenced these particular exposure proxies

Also , statistical differences of air concentrations of α-quartz between construction sites were observed ( P < 0.05 )
Acute Respiratory Effects of Exposure to Diesel Emissions in Coal Miners
As before , the years of diesel exposure relates only to that member of the pair who worked in an underground diesel-use mine
Given the strong correlation between ultrafines and PAHs , the use of this method for estimation of PAHs should be of comparable accuracy to its use for TC .
The stages at 3.16 , 1.78 , 1.00 , 0.54 , 0.37 , 0.148 , 0.105 , and 0.054 ¹m ( 50 % cutoff ) were used without grease with an after  filter to collect particles smaller than 0.054 ¹m
These characteristics were dictated by the low levels of air con­taminants to be measured , the rough environment encountered in rail­ road operations , and the lack of space and power in locomotive cabs and cabooses .
ABSTRACT
The mean ratio of PAHs to TC was 0.035 % ( range 0.016–0.044 % ) .Despite differences in experimental methods , these values are comparable to similar ratios derived from source sampling of a current technology heavy goods vehicle ( HGV ) of 0.056 % ( range 0.036–0.074 % ) at 1600 r.p.m
Median background mass concentration ( as measured before paving started but when the road was already trafficked ) was 21 μg/m3 , while median mass concentration during paving was 29 μg/m3
In these models , the diesel engine is considered the source and the exposed worker is the receptor
Most of the workers ( 77 % ) were monitored on more than one occasion
We found that all resultant exposure profiles were log-normally distributed
GM TC levels in truck bay and linemen samples were found to be signifi­cantly ( p = 0.0006 and p = 0.0489 ) different among facilities

According to Herrick et al. ( 19
For the tunnelling conditions , the sampled volume was smaller , between 2.9 and 10.3 m 3 , depending on the mining activities
TC levels in truck bay samples ( GM = 78 pg/m5 ) were significantly greater ( p = 0.001 ) than those in personal samples ( GM = 59 pg/m5 )
The aim of the present study was to investigate if underground miners exposed to dust and diesel exhaust in an iron ore mine would show signs of airway inflammation as reflected in induced sputum .
The yield of methylene chloride extractable material taken directly from the exhaust pipes of fire vehicles in Los Angeles was 0.26 + 0.02 ( n = 11 ) of the measured total particulates .

Quartz was the only crystalline silica polymorph detected in any of the fly ash samples
These MSHA limits are based on DPM being composed of approximately 80 % TC .
The 0.1 % concentration was selected because it is the cut-off concentration above which disclosure of crystalline silica is required on a material safety data sheet ( MSDS ) under the Canadian Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System ( WHMIS ) legislation ( Government of Canada , 1987 )
Therefore , the data are summarized using both arithmetic and geometric means and standard deviations .

Also , breathing zone concentrations of respirable dust did not change much in the oil shale mine from the pilot phase to the main study
Measurements were made on the main floor ( apparatus parking area ) with a continuous reading aerosol monitor ( RAM-I , GCA Inc. ) The direct reading aerosol monitor was placed between the truck and engine near the front of the vehicles
A short study was performed to evaluate the performance of three high-flow samplers ( FSP10 , CIP10-R , and GK2.69 ) using side-by-side sampling with low-flow samplers ( SIMPEDS and 10-mm nylon cyclones ) for RCS exposure measurement at a restoration stonemasonry field site
