However , for the personal sample , only 13 percent of the total mass was in the respirable range ( < 3.5l m ) , and for the area sample 30 percent was in the respirable range
Most of the uncertainties reflect the standard deviations between averaged samples , as the between sample variability was greater than the analytical uncertainty in most cases
Based on information gathered from the walkthrough , special trade subcontractor in 11 occupational groups having potential exposure to crystalline silica , lead , diesel exhaust , and noise were selected for quantitative assessment during a three-day follow-up survey conducted in June 2000

The proportion of RCS sampled in the respirable dust was greater with the SIMPEDS combinations than with the 10-mm nylon combinations , and there was more variability in the proportion of RCS in respirable dust in the 10-mm nylon trials ( 0.2 to 0.4 , compared with 0.6 to 0.7 for SIMPEDS )

These results indicated that the evaluation of farmers’ exposure to dust should be based on the examination of samples taken in the respiratory zone while performing individual work activities .
Fluid-phase measurements
However , EC in PM1 was chosen as the primary marker of diesel exposure because of interest in a marker of fresh diesel and other vehicle emissions before they had agglomerated into the accumulative mode of atmospheric aerosols
Because of limited temporal coverage in the EPA monitoring network ( collected only every other day ) , the AIRS data could not be matched directly with each individual driver route
A total of 108 personal breathing zone respirable dust air samples were collected
Although a reasonably clear day had been chosen for this experiment , the concentrations of smoke and hydrocarbons outside during the first period were rather high , due to the emission of smoke from a number of nearby domestic chimneys

The above results suggest the existence of intrinsic differences among possible pollutant sources .
As it will not be possible to specifically identify vehicles with exhaust leaks into the cabs , one goal of a detailed exposure assessment could be to determine if cab design is a significant predictor of exposure , and how exposure is broadly affected by model year and maintenance practices
About 59 % of these workers measured at baseline were reassessed during follow-up
similarly , humidity on the day of measurement was factored into three groups : < = 25 g.m−3 , > 25 – < = 45 g.m−3 , and > 45 g.m−3 , while respirable dust exposure was grouped as follows : < = 0.2 mg.m−3 , > 0.2 – < = 0.5 mg.m−3 and > 0.5 mg.m−3
Since no significant differences for concentrations could be observed between atomisation on/off a reduction factor for the heavy type of plate compactor ( CH ) could be derived only for 'real-time ' dust concentrations ( 56 % ) .
Or , perhaps dust control was not implemented for these jobs at these particular plants to the extent that it was for bagging , loading , and screening jobs .
This relationship was used to adjust the pDR-derived concentrations to be comparable with the standard nylon cyclone values
Casella cyclones collect the respirable dust fraction , which is relevant in determining exposure to respirable quartz

A 6-fold range in AEM levels was found across job groups-—from clerks witha bout 7 ug/ m3 exposure to repair shop workers with exposures around 45 ug/m3 .
The type of drill rig was a major determinant of all three types of exposures when drilling was performed for > 1.0 hours
Sampling was conducted in March and April , 1985 , in New York and Boston , and May and June , 1985 , in Los Angeles

The personal breathing zone samples indicated a respirable quartz dust concentration of 0.66 mg/m3 for the 191-minute sample duration
There were 206 workers sampled for respirable dust and silica
This too is responsible for some of the sample variability

Surface workers and their matches are shown separately
Generally , helper locomotive crews make only three to four trips a day through these long tunnels and their exposure levels are within OSHA standards .
PAH analysis
Plant characteristics
The reference measure of exposure ( OSHA standard ) for most substances is the \" 8-hour time weighted average \" ( TWA ) in one 8-hour work shift for a 40 hour work week .
SiC is produced as either green or black crystals from a mixture of high-grade quartz sand and petrol coke
they were , therefore , classified as intermittent high exposure
The adjusted geometric mean quartz concentrations for the plants were usually lower than the unadjusted mean because , in general , more measurements were collected during the early years when quartz exposures were higher and greater weighting was given these high-early samples when unadjusted mean exposures were calculated

In total , 68 construction workers had at least one measurement on both occasions
The additional sites B and Q had been set up in places considered to be particularly affected by pollution during the morning run-out
The sampling method has been described in detail elsewhere
Though perhaps higher than desirable , the dust concentrations are within the exposure limits
Whereas in 1994/1995 dpm has been measured and evaluated as \" total carbon \" , it was determines as \" elemental carbon ( ec ) \" since then .
Multivariate regression models were used to identify determinants associated with the dust exposures within the job groups .
Comparison with Table 5 and 6 shows that the maximum levels measured are several orders of magnitude lower than those found in tunnel operations
Together with the 10 Hr engine bay continuous samplers , a number of instantaneous measurements and active sampling techniques were applied for the activities as listed in table .

The average mass change of 1-day blanks were subtracted from the mass change for samples collected that day
Separately for men and women , unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) of lung cancer associated with various categorical EC exposure metrics , including ever/never exposure , duration of exposure ( < 10 , 10–19 , 20–29 , and > 29 yr ) , and cumulative exposure ( quartiles of exposure distribution among controls : > 0–22 , 23–70 , 71–178 , > 178 μg/m3-years )
The same procedure was repeated on the second day , and the subjects also completed a questionnaire on their medical history , nonworkplace exposures , diet , cigarette smoking , and other lifestyle factors
This is most likely due to a sampling system malfunction on the first day of sampling
Much of the data on smoking and window status are missing , which complicated the modeling effort

The final models explained 72 and 83 % of the between-worker variance , and 69 and 22 % of the day-to-day variability for respirable dust and quartz , respectively .
