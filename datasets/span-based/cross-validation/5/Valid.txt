A slightly more extensive suite of PAHs was measured in this study , accounting for the marginally higher ratios reported .
MATERIALS AND METHODS
• Appropriate storage facilities
Census Bureau 1997 ) and reports to OSHA inspectors by the facility ( OSHA IMIS 2003 ) , the percentage and number of workers potentially exposed to crystalline silica by selected industries were estimated .
The study was conducted at a tunnel construction site
Three of the 37 measurements of respirable silica concentration and percent silica were found to be below the analytical limit of detection ( LOD ) of 0.005 mg quartz
Air monitoring , both with and without the use of dust collection equipment , was conducted during the grinding portion of tuckpointing operations
As mentioned previously , the tracers are uniformly greater than the urban background ( except hostler PAH concentrations ) , with the wax alkanes , steranes and hopanes enriched in that order over the urban background in all personal exposures

All the airborne concentrations in this paper are from personal monitoring except where noted as being from static samplers ( results from static sampling should be viewed with caution as they are strongly dependent on the exact position of the sampler in relation to the work )
Prior to the commencement of the study , the researcher met with depot managers and workers and presented an overview of the project objectives and proposed sampling protocols
The results are presented here by industry .
When the conditions were reported to be worse than usual the most frequent explanation was that the ventilation system was not functioning
It was used with either a diamond blade of diameter 230 mm or a composite resin blade of the same diameter
The detection limit with 8-h sampling time was therefore 0.063 mg m−3 for total dust and 0.057 mg m−3 for respirable dust
EC and OC containing particles were collected on pre-cleaned quartz filters ( Pallflex Tissue quartz 2500QAT-UP , Pall Corporation , Port Washington , NY , USA ) using a 37-mm standard , three-part aero- sol filter cassette ( Millipore , MA , USA )

Samples were considered adequate for analysis if the squamous cell contamination was < 20 % and the viability > 50 %
Station 5
The RCS concentration exhibited significant correlations with the RD and TD concentrations
If the wind was fluctuating during a scan or if the paving machine stopped temporarily , the particle concentration could suddenly drop to background levels
It follows then , in the personal exposure samples in this study , that high alkanes can be considered indicative of cigarette smoke

The geometric mean quartz concentration was 25.9 µm/m3 ( GSD = 10.9 ) with a range from less than 1 to 11,700 µm/m3
Because precision is related to the filter loadings , all summary statistics and statistical analysis recorded here should be interpreted with some degree of caution .
The modeled exposure estimates improve upon duration of employment as an estimate of cumulative exposure and reduce exposure misclassification due to variation in quartz levels between plants , jobs , and over time .
Figure 8 indicates that both highway and residential background levels were significantly higher in warmer weather
However , the simple arithmetic mean is a poor estimator of the population mean when the dis­tribution is lognormal
However , this can not explain all of the differences seen between the job groups .
Separate analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of control measures , stratified by job category , because the use of specific control measures varied by job category
The variability in the amount of silica is likely due to the varying percent of quartz in the sand and varying amounts of sand used in the two products

The limestone face is then cleaned with a diesel-powered power pick and metallic structures are placed to consolidate the arch
Another way to state this is that the thoracic concentration is not a simple linear function of the respirable concentration or the regression coeffi­cient ( squared correlation coefficient ) would be greater than 0.90 .
For outdoor measurements , the number of ultrafine particles may be influenced by atmospheric conditions , e.g. , ambient temperature ( 14 ) and wind speed and direction. ( 15,16 ) On a calm day one could expect a higher particle concentration at the paving site , especially since peak concentrations up to 2.2x105 cm−3 were frequently observed during paving activities .
This study , by quantifying workers’ exposure levels through a multimetric approach , contributes to thef urther understanding of occupational exposures to diesel engine exhaust .

Hypertonic saline ( 4.5 % ) was nebulised using an ultrasonic nebuliser ( DeVilbis 2000
Due to the relatively wide range of particle sizes represented on each stage , this approach may contain some error
Perhaps the larger quantity of water being thrown off the blade produced larger aerosol particles that dropped out of the air more quickly , whereas with less water , the aerosol produced was more in the respirable range , creating a mist that remained airborne longer

Twenty to 30 underground workers were monitored each day for a full shift ( approximately 8 hours )
The reserved aliquots of the sample extracts were concentrated further to about 50 uL and spiked with naphthalene and chrysene as internal standards
Parallel measurements of CO2 , together with carbon monoxide ( CO ) , temperature and relative humidity , were taken using a Q Trak detector ( TSI )
One can thus evaluate the contribution of this genotoxic risk to the lung-cancer risk by dividing the PAC lung risk by the total lung risk based on EC measurement

Jammers drove heavy-duty diesel vehicles that packed processed waste rock back into cavities in the mine
Separate models were constructed for total dust , respirable dust , fiber , quartz , cristobalite , and SiC
METHODOLOGY
Many operations , like trades , had highly skewed exposure distributions ( Table II and III )
Precipitation data were not col­lected because air sampling was not performed during periods of any significant precipitation .
Because of the inconvenience of the sampling system , it was only possible to collect a few personal samples .
Maximum slow-response noise levels ranged from 105 to 138 dBA
The limited data did not permit a formal statistical analysis

Personal Sampling Results
The GM and GSD values of respirable dust ( n = 38 ) and RCS ( n = 19 ) for measured values above the LOD for Factories A–D were 0.53 ± 3.8 mg/m3 and 0.23 ± 3.7 mg/m3 , respectively
Discussions with colliery management indicated the use of a low sulfur diesel fuel , good road conditions throughout the mine which minimized engine revving , an intensive scheduled maintenance program , a system for limiting the number of vehicles in ventilation splits , a computerized weekly exhaust emission testing program , and a policy of replacing older design engines led to the improved conditions .
The holes were used to attach a gripping device so that a small crane could lift the concrete block out of the pavement .

In addition to conducting abrasive blasting , blasters were also responsible for material handling ( moving new abrasive , removing used abrasive ) , quality control , and work site clean-up
Questions included the occurrence of work-related sore throat , nasal congestion , cough with phlegm , chest tightness and wheeze
therefore , logarithms of concentrations were used for all calculations and statistical tests .
If grinding occurred during a greater portion of the sampling time , quartz may have been measured in these samples .
It is suspected that dolomitic limestone has been used as fill behind the brick lining of the arch and that the material at the drill hole comes from the drill tip whereas the airborne dust comes from abrasion with the brick at the outer end of the hole .
A comparison of the mean exposures between the area samples was also carried out ( Table 5 )

A protection factor of 5 was assigned to the single-use dust masks and a 10 to the disposable HEPA half masks worn by the trades .
A single operator was employed for each system , to eliminate the effects of variation in work practices , such as operator position
ORs for increasing humidity on the day of measurement , when adjusted for the other variables , were well above one ( 95 % CIs did not span 1 ) as was the case for univariate analysis
A study was conducted to determine if acute respiratory effects , measured in terms of changes in forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV , ) , and maximal expiratory flow rate at 50 % of forced vital capacity ( Vmax 50 ) , were related to exposure to diesel emissions in coal miners
Maximum forced expiratory volume in 1 sec ( FEV1 ) , forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , peak flow rate ( PFR ) , and flows at 50 and 75 % of expired FVC ( FEF % 0 , FEF75 ) were obtained by lining up the after-shift maximum envelope at total lung capacity of the before-shift maximum envelope and measuring flows at before-shift percentages of FVC
This has been verified with a limited set of GPS data collected from drivers , suggesting that the use of average location characteristics around the home terminal to predict driver exposures is subject to a high degree of exposure misclassification
