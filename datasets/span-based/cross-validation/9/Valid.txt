The laboratory was instructed to analyze samples with the following priority : burn samples , then field preparation samples , then harvest samples
Three of the slab saw jobs were similar in that they used similar blade sizes and cut area ( Table II )
The 1-NP concentrations were also higher underground than on the surface ( 2- to 3-fold in the coal mine and 10-fold or more in the oil shale mine )
A more accurate characterization of exposure could be obtained by using a work sampling method which more precisely records a worker 's distance from the source of exhaust

Dust Exposure
As the carcinogenicity of DEPs is assumed to be due to a non-genotoxic pathway ( particulate core ) and a genotoxic pathway ( adsorbed organics , mainly PACs ) , the total occupational lung-cancer risk , determined by the EC-corrected DEP unit risk factor times the EC concentration , can be estimated in a first approximation as the contribution of both pathways
This simulation was repeated at least 10 – 15 times to ensure a sufficient volume of air was passed through the collection filters , and the subsequent laboratory analysis limit of detection ( LOD ) was appropriate for the occupational exposure concentrations
The rel­atively low regression coefficients ( 0.42 for quartz and 0.48 for dust ) suggest that these are not a simple linear function of each other ( Table VI ) .
The study focused on characterising emissions within the context of the normal operation of a fire station and included specific activities and work areas

Chassis dynamometer testing may also be used to obtain data on emissions directly from heavy-duty diesel vehicles using simulated driving conditions
The study site was an underground gold mine located in the eastern part of Nevada ( in the U.S . )
This study also suggests that particle-associated 1-NP much better reflects the ambient exposure to diesel exhaust particles than dust concentrations
Emphasis was placed on evaluation of furnace area exposures
Shotcreting operators and drill and blast workers were the highest exposed workers to NH3 ( GM = 2927 and 2857 μg m−3 , respectively )
Quartz , as a percentage of the respirable dust samples , ranged from 2.2 to 21.0 % depending on activity .
Statistical modeling of the determinants of exposure indicated that the tasks of mechanical scaling ( removal of loose rock using a hydraulic jackhammer ) , shotcreting , drilling ( with no cab ) , and repairing the ventilation duct increased the total dust exposure level , while assisting with the drilling operation ( e.g. , detaching the drill head when it was stuck in the drilling hole , etc. ) was associated with a decreased exposure ( Table V )

Some of these punches were spiked with sucrose in quantities similar to the levels of OC originally found on the sample
Moreover , EC is not a significant component of cigarette smoke ( 0.49 % ) and is a small component of gasoline car engine emissions ( 2-5 mg/km ) and propane emissions when compared with heavy-duty truck engine emissions ( early 1990s technology , 164 mg/km ) .
The sampling rate was about 6 1/min , and each filter was run for a single 24 hour period
Drill and Blast Workers
LEV capture hood systems installed were used for all grinding , cutting , and decoration tasks carried out in the stone workshops
Generally , personal exposures will be expected to be higher than background exposures since the operator will usually be closer to the source of the pollutant

The molten suspensions were mixed immediately with a Vortex mixer and poured onto minimal glucose plates
In the absence of total lung capacity ( TLC ) , flow rates were not directly corrected for lung volumes
These measures probably will not be useful in assessing exposure levels because only the concentrations within a certain range of a specified limit value were usually recorded
The Wilcoxon signed rank test indicated no difference ( P < 0.05 ) between the carcinogenic PAC profile in the bus depot and truck repair workshop , either according to season ( summer or winter ) or sampling-pump type ( total suspended or respirable particles )
Descriptive statistics ( means , standard deviations , and confidence limits ) were first compiled by the categories being examined for both elemental and organic carbon concentrations
Data on the specific activities ( e.g. , planting , harvesting ) , job functions ( e.g. , tractor driving ) , and conditions ( e.g. , cabbed or uncabbed tractors ) were recorded for each sample using a standardized form .
Several specific aspects of the data ( e.g. , methods comparisons ) were explored by using linear regression techniques

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Concrete drillers used control measures more frequently ( 83 % ) than demolishers ( 38 % ) and tuck pointers ( 28 % )
Isokinetic sampling was not considered necessary because diesel particu­lates , mainly submicrometer in size , behave much like a gas under dilution tube conditions/28 .
At the oil shale mine this difference was ~5-fold in the pilot study , but in the main study it was reduced to a factor of less than two .
The highest level seen in area samples was 9.9 fibers/cc for fibers > 5 μm in length in the respirable dust fraction

Exposure characterization
On some occasions , industrial hygiene investigators assume the content of crystalline silica in bulk dust is similar to that found in air samples and may , therefore , limit crystalline silica analysis to bulk samples in a desire to limit the likelihood of nondetects from limited amounts of dust captured in air samples
