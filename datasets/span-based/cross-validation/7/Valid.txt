and six were “drivers” ( five truck drivers and one loading machine driver ) .
Particles in the range 0.02–1 µm are counted
Exposures were higher for sweeping compound , box fan for cleanup , ducted fan dilution , and wetted substrate
For the grinder , the 342-minute personal breathing zone sample indicated a respirable dust concentration of 0.36 mg/m 3 and a respirable quartz concentration of 0.02 mg/m 3 , which was between the limit of detection and limit of quantification for the sample
Figure 2A shows that geometric mean respirable dust concentrations per job per site per campaign varied over three orders of magnitude from 0.01 to 10 mg/m3
i.e. , an increase in number concentration of particles also gave an increase in mass concentration of particles at the paving site

MMP-9 levels were greater in miners than controls , but were reduced following a 3-month period at work ( table 4 ) .
We use EC as the primary exposure proxy for DEE for analyses of biological end points since EC is considered a specific marker for DEE in occupational settings and has been used in the most recent epidemiological investigations of lung cancer.7 8 There was no correlation between EC and PM2.5 among the DEE exposed subjects ( R=0.09 , p=0.53 )
A random sample of workers from each job group was measured

This task-based approach has been used to assess workers’ exposures for industries with dynamic occupational settings , such as constructions , geotechnical laboratory workers , slate industry , and quartz manufacturing
Short-term variations in exposure were assessed by measurement of air quality in truck cabs , loading docks , and yards in 2 large urban terminals and 4 small rural terminals
These SEGs were modeling ( i.e. , molding-sand preparation , core making , and core assembly ) , casting ( such as scrap-metal preparation , melting , casting , and cooling ) , sand-box cleaning ( i.e. , shakeout and sand recycling ) , sand blasting ( i.e. , shot blasting and transportation ) , polishing ( such as grinding/fettling and painting ) , and office areas

The attendance rate was 100 % for both the index group and the reference group
The airflow was set by dry calibration before and after air sampling
There is no established national exposure standard for tvocs , however the QFRS adopts a level of concern ( LOC ) of 0.5 ppm for application at emergency incidents
µ is the true underlying mean of log-transformed exposure averaged over all groups
Studies of the level of free silica in airborne dust showed the greatest amounts of this mineral component in dust accompanying mechanical and manual treatment of crop , spring ploughing and beets digging
Samples were collected during normal production shifts in the ventilation in the intake , in the haulageway , on the shuttle cars , and in the return
The total lymphocyte count and three of four major lymphocyte subsets including CD4+ T cells , CD8+ T cells and B cell counts were statistically significantly increased in workers exposed to DEE compared to controls ( table 3 ) , with 16–25 % higher cell counts in exposed versus control workers
These preliminary evaluations of the sampling technique indicate that these are accurate to within 25 pct , 95 pct of the time , for concentration levels above the estimated limit of detection of 0.3 mg/m3
The following job categories were included : bricklayer , carpenter , concrete driller , demolisher , and tuck pointer .
A term for weather or climate can also be considered for each model : The Zaebst data showed large differences in exposure measurements for warm and cold weather
Also , duplicate analysis on a total of seven filters was performed by analyzing two different wedges from the same filter
In order to investigate determinants of RCS exposure and their contribution to the individual’s mean exposure , mixed-effects modelling with forward inclusion of the variables was carried out using the log-transformed RCS 8-h TWA data for materials granite and sandstone ( n = 65 ) as the dependant variable
Populations studied
Because this study is part of an exposure assessment in an epidemiological study , it has been reviewed and approved by the Institute Review Board of College of Public Health of the China Medical University ( Ethic code : 100-03-10-04 ) before the implementation
These missing data complicated the use of multiple regression techniques , and for this reason , the impact of the predictors are estimated and discussed individually

METHODS AND MATERIALS
The questionnaire regarding psychosocial factors was administered to all 116 workers
The vast majority of personal and area samples were 7- to 8-hour long-term samples
Some activities showed little difference in exposure between target and nontarget tasks ( cleanup , sacking/patching , and floor sanding ) , and others showed clearly elevated exposure during the target task ( grinding , demolition , cutting , and mixing )
Although exact matching was attempted on these factors , it could not be achieved and variance was allowed
The monitor was bought from TSI in 2005 and was not calibrated before the measurements that were carried out in 2006 .
The sampling results indicated that equipment operators were exposed to diesel exhaust levels of up to five times the NIOSH REL , and that the construction laborers’ exposures ranged up to 10 times the REL ( worst-case scenario , given that none of the workers remained in the sublevel for the entire shift ) .
The urban background , as represented by the Supersite samples , is plotted vs

ABSTRACT
Sampling Methods
RESULTS
This equipment was worn while the blaster was actively engaged in abrasive blasting , which comprised about half of their total activities over the work shift
Twenty-three quartz samples collected from the SIMPEDS combinations were removed because their values were less than the LOD
- Potential determinants were carefully chosen to prevent multi-collinearity
Each of the coal miners was asked to wear a personal dust sampler
The pumps were calibrated at 2.5 SL/min , with an expected 50 % cut size of 4.0 m
The half-face masks were of type SR-62/80 with dust filter 210
Considering the aging of the concrete infrastructure in the United States , these results pose a challenge to all who have an interest in preventing silica exposures and the associated disease silicosis .
However , for the off-site drivers , only urban background and personal exposure have been measured
We do not know the extent of exposure in the different professions or the variation between the different work tasks
Smoking vehicles are often identified based on a visible smoke plume , which in the case of the ‘‘white smokers’’ are often a result of burning lubricating oil , which is possible with both gasoline and diesel vehicles
Depending upon the particle size of the aerosol being studied , different inlets are used
Two of these companies also provided data for 1980 , and data for additional dates were acquired from some companies
The EC method specifies the use of a sampler with a total dust open-face configuration , and in coal mines , a sampler with an impactor employing a submicron cut point is specified .
Measured respirable dust and quartz concentrations by agriculture activity are presented in Tables 3 and 4
Field blanks consisted of sampling cassettes loaded with filters , which were taken to the field together with the sample cassettes but were never opened ( i.e
The sampler operates at a flow rate of 2 L/min , which is compatible with both the personal sampler pump and the 10-mm cyclone .
These 12 samples had a geometric mean ( GM ) of 6.1 ug/m3 ( ge-ometric standard deviation [ GSD ] 2.3 )
however , manual watering is time intensive and less likely to be implemented in practice
The same authors also reported particle concentrations from urban sites , for example , where a street canyon ( Hornsgatan ) in Stockholm had a monthly average of 6x 104–7x104 cm−3 ( cutoff diameter 10 nm ) .
To be sure that differences between the groups of drivers were not only an effect of differences in the urban background levels , the average urban background values for the day ( nitrogen dioxide and PM10respectively ) were subtracted from the measured average value for each individual
The bulk of the XRF elements were composed of species such as silicon , calcium , and iron that would be derived primarily from resuspended ore/waste rock in the mine .
The underground workers had higher exposure to total and respirable dust , α‐quartz and nitrogen dioxide than the references ( p < 0.001 )
Some non-parametric tests , such as the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test , have been used to assess the difference between the selected working situations
Filters collected with samplers that did not meet this criterion due to pump failure were rejected .

ABSTRACT
Atmospheric Contaminants –VOCs of Interest – hexane , benzene , toluene and xylene
Using the lung cancer risk from our linear continuous exposure model with all subjects , we calculated lung cancer excess lifetime risks ( ELRs ) at age 80 associated with 45 years of occupational EC exposure at 50 , 20 , and 1 μg/m3 using life-table methods accounting for all-cause mortality outlined by Vermeulen and colleagues ( Vermeulen et al. , 2014 )
The lubricating oil-impacted exhaust is taken from a \" white smoker , \" or normal-smoking gasoline vehicle , which has elevated lubricating oil markers ( hopanes and steranes ) , but not elevated PAH or EC
Measurement of blaster exposure was challenging in this study as the blasters evaluated conducted this task intermittently throughout the work shift , frequently removing their blasting helmets
Factors important to exposure included tool used , work area configuration , controls employed , cross draft , and in some cases nearby dust
The highest fire station concentration was the Loganlea dormitory ( 54 ppb ) , which is ca
The tube was directly read after the completion of the recommended pumps
Because of the large number of samples only gravimetrically determined respirable dust and inhalable dust results are presented here
Many of the speciated organics in these samples had agreement worse than 30 %
A number of difficulties were documented when sampling for diesel exhaust using organic carbon : high and variable blank values from filters , a high variability ( +/- 20 % ) from duplicate punches from the same sampling filter , a consistent positive interference ( +26 % ) when open-faced monitors were sampled side-by-side with cyclones , poor correlation ( r 2 = 0.38 ) to elemental carbon levels , and an interference from limestone that could not be adequately corrected by acid-washing of filters
It also offered the flexibility to roam around each site to measure short-term exposures for multiple trades .
Based on results , neopterin level of serum in exposed group is higher than the unexposed group , and there is a significant difference between them ( ANOVA , P < 0.001 )
Further work needs to be conducted to thoroughly quantify differences between these measurement tech­niques with more samples and in a controlled environment
More than 90 % of the cristobalite samples from each of these departments were below the detection limit and the corresponding results for quartz exposure levels in these departments were 65 and 58 % , respectively .
The occupational sampling results indicate that two-thirds of the workers assessed were potentially over-exposed to respirable crystalline silica
< 0.05 to 0.30 mg m−3 ( RD ) and < 0.01 to 0.08 mg m−3 ( RCS ) .
Exposure is common in the mining industry and consequently , the US Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) evaluates miners’ exposure to silica to determine compliance with its exposure limit .
For some activities ( tuck-point grinding , cleanup , demolition ) the subject worked at the target task for most of the sampling session

This article will focus on the elemental carbon findings and present submicrometer or diesel particulate matter ( DPM ) and nitrogen dioxide concentrations for comparison purposes .
The highest value for respirable dust ( 278 µg/m ) had an anomalously low corresponding EC value .
Due to experimental limitations in the very first campaign in 1995 only the particulate components ( \" dpm \" , respirable and inhalable dust ) could be measured .
The experiment was conducted by us­ing a dynamometer and dilution tube apparatus ( Figure 1 ) located at Ford Motor Co.’s Research and Engineering Center in Dear­born , Michigan
The geometric mean ( GM ) , geometric standard deviation ( GSD ) , and minimum and maximum values were calculated using descriptive statistics
however , these systems were observed to be ineffective at containing the dust as dust plumes were observed travelling beyond the barrier or were compromised ( curtains tied back , doors between work areas left open )
Measured respirable silica and respirable dust concentrations as well as percentage silica content by farm , county , agricultural activity , and crop type are given in Table I
Table 3 shows these manufacturing sections by respirable dust and quartz concentrations in air in the workplace .

Reduction ( % ) = [ 1 - 1/ ( AM atomiser off/ AM atomiser on ) ] * 100 ( 1 )
One terminal used propane-fueled forklift trucks , and the other used gasoline-fueled forklift trucks
Because no other significant sources of elemental carbon are present in locomotive repair facilities , or on board locomotives , it may be possible to use widely available cyclone samplers instead of a submicron sampler like the Marple .
The sampling heights best represented the likely breathing zones of the fire fighters undertaking activities in these areas .
Thus only those comparisons in which the number of valid pairs is reasonably large ( for example , greater than 11 ) should be considered as indicating a likely difference between samplers .
Three vehicles were in the station : a fire engine , a hook and ladder truck , and a chief’s car ( van ) .
In the case of dust it was by a factor of almost three ( Table VI )
two were fired with lignite coal , and the remaining four plants used bituminous and subbituminous coals

Sampling was conducted at construction sites with samplers positioned close to operations producing moderate to high concrete dust concentrations
The terrain was categorized as flat , rolling , or mountainous , and it was noted whether the windows were open or closed
The 7 mines included in the study were involved in mining coal ( 1 in the Czech Republic and 3 in Slovakia ) , oil shale ( 1 in Estonia ) , bauxite ( 1 in Poland ) , and magnesite ( 1 in Slovakia )
This is the value above which MSHA issues a citation for non-compliance
These re­sults were included in the overall statistical analysis by substitut­ing a value of one-half of the limit of detection for each “less- than” value .
The workers were divided into job groups according to department ( furnace , processing , or maintenance department ) and tasks performed
This individual’s personal activity generated a much higher concentration of the same lube oil/motor vehicle source represented by the remaining mechanic and shop area samples
Statistics
and from sources in close proximity to the workers , that is , in his or her near field ( CNF ) :
This is the best range of deposit for organic carbon for the method ( range 5–200 u g/cm2 )
Exposure to respirable dust was highest among tuck pointers , whereas concrete drillers were exposed to the highest quartz levels
However , respirable quartz exposures were not higher on June 17 .
For a source in the far field of the worker , similar considerations apply , and so the following equation gives the far-field contribution to the exposure level :

The increase above background for both EC and OC is likely to be proportional to the number of vehicles assigned to the terminal and to the volume of freight handled .
The relevance of engine certification data for predicting in-use emissions has not been established because the test process may not represent actual operating conditions .
However , the OC apportionment , which shows large contributions from lubricating oil-impacted exhaust , illustrates that occupational diesel expo-sure contains a significant OC component that may not be tracked effectively by only measuring EC concentrations .
Sampling was performed at each of the seven farms at least once

ABSTRACT
3 )
The experiments during demolition using the heavy type of jackhammer were conducted on two consecutive days where temperature and RH were 12°C +-1 and 66 % +- 2.5 respectively
The fibers were of complex morphology , often with no parallel sides
The concentrations observed while the doors were open ( i.e. , black circles ) produce a pattern more conducive to a threshold effect , albeit based almost entirely on one sample with relatively high levels of both RCD and EC-C
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) permissible exposure limit ( PEL ) was used in those instances where the measurement sampling time was not consistent with that required for comparison to the ACGIH TLV
The lightweight type soil compactor ( Errut PC 400 ) , weighed 81 kg and had a flat plate and a tamping frequency of 60000 b/min
Table 5 indicates that if this is taken into account , these biologically active PAHs increase the B [ a ] Peq concentration by a mean factor of 5±2 .

Exposed workers were selected from an engine testing facility of a diesel engine manufacturing company that produces diesel engines for light and heavy trucks ( production between 10 000 and 20 000 engines a month )
Our discussions indicated that major job-specific duties had not changed significantly over time for most jobs
30 % of these measurements exceeded the Irish OELV of 0.1mg m−3
Measurements of the effectiveness of dust control on cut-off saws used in the construction industry
Both arithmetic and geometric means were calculated and reported
The measured PM levels were corrected using the gravimetric calibration factor , which was determined by collecting parallel samples on PVC filters ( 37-mm , pore size 5.0 μm , SKC , Inc. , USA ) mounted on the PEM samplers
Toluene and xylenes were present in the greatest abundance
Drivers were asked to perform their normal driving activities with a sampling box mounted in the cab to measure particle concentrations in their work environment
In 1972 and again in 2000 , the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) recommended an exposure limit for respirable silica of 50 µg/m3 for a 10-hr work shift as necessary to prevent silicosis [ NIOSH , 1972 , 2000 ]
At Merton these indicate that the sites chosen for the main samplers ( P and Q ) did have the highest concentrations , when averaged over the complete 24 hours , though those in the office and dock were not far behind

In addition , high-volume respirable dust samples were obtained 0 0 on 37-mm PVC filters using 1/2 \" metal cyclones ( Sensidyne model 18 ) and constant-flow pumps calibrated at 9.0 L/min
This implies that the DEP unit risk factor has to be further corrected in order for this fact to be taken into account
APPROACH
All four measurements rank site 29 as producing significantly higher exposures than the other sites
For walk-behind saws , blade size ranged from 14 to 24 inches , with 14- and 18-inch blades most commonly used
This relationship is displayed in Figure 3 for the subset of P & D drivers with the median EC value graphed by production year ( group medians are more representative of the central tendency due to the non-normality of exposure data )
Air concentrations of NO2 and NH3 were measured with portable direct-reading electrochemical sensors with data logging built into the instruments ( PAC7000 Dräger AK , Lübeck , Germany )
These locomotives may or may not be occupied by train crew members .

This suggests a difference in sources for the particulate matter and organic compounds between these jobs .
There are large service doors at both ends of the two tracks , and each track is equipped with an overhead exhaust canopy
Maximum noise levels for each of these samples are also reported in Table III
The between-depot , between-worker , and within-worker variance components were reduced by 46 , 89 and 49 % , respectively , after including task in the mixed effects model ( Table 5 )
These were operated using low flow sampling pumps calibrated using a bubble flow meter to 15–20 ml/min
Quartz content of the samples was determined using x ray diffraction
For RCS , only quartz was detected , and the quartz concentration was quantified using the height of the peak rather than its area ( to avoid interference from mullite and feldspar contained in the coal briquettes )
As with P and D driver , s the concentrations for all species are is significantly higher than the urban background concentrations
Respirable dust and crystalline silica samples were collected at a flow rate of 1.7 L/min using a respirable dust cyclone and a 5-μm pore size , 37-mm diameter polyvinylchloride ( PVC ) filter in a polystyrene cassette
There were 170 paired personal respirable dust and elemental carbon ( EC ) samples used to calculate the fraction of respirable dust that was diesel .
A 10-second data logging interval was used
In each mine half of the study population worked underground as drivers of diesel-powered trains ( black coal ) and excavators ( oil shale )
A summary of elemental carbon ( EC ) concentrations by job category is given in Table IX
The 1-NP content of the membrane filters was analysed following the method described in Scheepers et al
All six of the inspected companies received a violation for not providing hazard communication training for silica exposure and not having an MSDS for the fibercement boards .
Because this study is more interested in defining the average or most typical relationships , the statistics which omit that individual will be used in all further discussions .
This diesel exhaust had aged for several minutes to several hours and was identical to the exhaust breathed by the workers

The study population consisted of 35 restoration stoneworkers employed with the Commissioners of Public Works Ireland , responsible for managing , maintaining , and restoring over 740 of Ireland’s national monuments
ABSTRACT
These samples were enriched in OC , which could have arisen from exposure to drilling oils or cigarette smoke or the diesel vehicles operating in a mode that produce d a more evenly distributed OC/EC composition relative to what was most com­ mon in the mine
When comparing the four work tasks differences in dust concentrations were found for TD ( F = 18.9 , df = 19 , p < 0.001 ) , but not for RD ( F = 3.16 , df = 10 , p = 0.10 )
In addition , 1 sample was col­lected to include 2 side-by-side personal samplers along with 1 of the stationary samplers to compare the 2 methods
Ninety percent of fibers were < 2.5 μm in width
Six to 20 baskets of air samples were taken at each facility , each containing five or more DPM samplers

The Air Quality Information monitors use a semi-continuous OCEC field instrument ( Sunset Laboratory Inc. , USA ) for EC/OC/TC , and aethalometer ( model AE22 , Magee Scientific Company , USA ) for BC
Extensive cleaning activities are usually not performed during these short-term repairs
The local outdoor and indoor source terms are defined by types and intensities of emission sources and modifiers
Operations such as longwall moves and stonedusting , which generate elevated levels of dust , cause severe interference to submicron DP measurements
