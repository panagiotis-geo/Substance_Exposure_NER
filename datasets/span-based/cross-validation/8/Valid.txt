SUMMARY OF ALL FIRE STATION RESULTS
Dust in the respiratory zone was collected in 2 series covering 2 measurements of total dust concentration each and 2-6 measurements of the level of respirable dust .
Environmental measurements
This was due to the absence of carpenters in the intervention group and the low exposure levels at baseline for both bricklayers and carpenters , which left very little potential for improvement ( van Deurssen et al. , 2014 )
Methods : We used one indicator of the gaseous phase , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , and one of the particle phase ( measured by DataRAM ) , of the exhausts
Material ( granite or sandstone ) , enclosure , RPE , weather , LEV , and task duration were not found to improve the model so were not included

The results highlight the relevance of direct reading instruments in helping to identify sources of exposure and suggest that monitoring particle number concentrations improves understanding of workers’ exposures to diesel exhaust
However , some workers could not be included again during follow-up for practical reasons : they were working at inaccessible worksites or they were unemployed at the time of the follow-up measurements

These factors could then be used to determine past exposure conditions by modeling the effects of changes in the factors
The samples were obtained at a flow rate of 2 Lpm ( not 4 Lpm as were the field samples ) because no flow-sensitive size-selective device was used and because concentrations of particulates in the chamber were predictably high .
The highest silica concentration ( 0.36 [ 0.13 ] mg/m3 ) was related to glazing workers , and the lowest concentration ( 0.11 [ 0.04 ] mg/m3 ) was obtained for the workers of subordinate and small parts of the factory [ Table 2 ]

The substance-specific data sets were evaluated using both subjective and objective goodness-of-fit procedures to deter- mine if the lognormal distributional model was appropriate for describing the exposure profiles. ( 14,18 ) Goodness-of-fit is not an issue whenever non-parametric statistics are calculated , as these statistics do not require a distributional model
Before and after each sampling day , the DustTrak was zerochecked to ±0.001 mg/m3 using a special filter
Such distributions were excluded from the data set , while all complete scans ( where no obvious change in wind direction was observed nor any temporary paving stops occurred ) were added , and the result was divided by the number of scans to get an average size distribution

Because it is well supported by available data , it was concluded that an average exposure ( over the entire 5-year period considered in these data ) greater than 50 µg/m3 was a risk factor for silicosis and for lung cancer .
We conducted a cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study in a diesel engine truck testing facility of 54 workers exposed to a wide range of DEE ( ie , elemental carbon air levels , median range : 49.7 , 6.1-107.7 mg/m3 ) and 55 unexposed comparable controls .
These percentages are somewhat lower than are typically reported for diesel particles and indicate the probable presence of sources of nondiesel particles

Within industries , the autroregressive error model AR ( 2 ) predicted that the construction industry has significantly lower airborne silica exposure levels ( p = 0.10 ) during this time period
Diesel exhaust is a complex mixture of chemical substances , including a particulate fraction mainly composed of ultrafine particles , resulting from the incomplete combustion of fuel
For EC in the lead locomotive the exposure rating could be either category 2 or 3 ( which reflects the fact that the sample 95th percentile is roughly half of the working OEL , therefore nearly equal to the dividing line between category 2 and 3 )

For this pooled Group ( A + B ) , all correlations were statistically significant , most of them with P < 0.01
The ratios of OC to EC were similar for all samples , so it is unlikely that these higher exposures were due to contamination

Sampling Strategy
This checklist was developed with reference to similar studies ( HSE , 2006
It may be that control strategies were employed only when high exposures were anticipated , so increased exposures while using controls does not necessarily suggest that exposures increased with the use of these controls .
The differences were also large relative to measurement error of the monitoring techniques
Neopterin level of serum in exposed group is higher than the unexposed group , and there is a significant difference between them ( P < 0.001 , 6.90 [ 2.70 ] vs

As a rule of thumb personal sampling was generally preferred , but for several reasons in some cases stationary samplers had to be applied as well
47 samples were collected from these places with mean sampling time of 60–120 min at the personal breathing zone of the workers during a normal work shift .
To investigate if any differences between the driver groups were influenced by variations in background air pollution , we calculated the drivers’ exposure both with and without adjustment for background air pollution during the day of the measurement .

In a former study we could show , that under the conditions of underground mining with directed ventilation present in all workplaces , the differences for diesel particulate matter between personal and stationary sampling results tend to be very small , if the stationary sampling is performed \" near the source \" ( as required by German regulation ) because of the ultrafine nature of that particulate aerosol .

In addition to the assessment of exposure to total particulates under normal operating conditions , the authors also estimated the most severe exposure to diesel particulates that a firefighter might encounter during an 8-hr period in a Los Angeles fire station
The number of workers present and the intensity of activity varied widely through a shift
The original plan included additional sampling to characerize the statistical variability , but that plan was dropped when the budget was reduced by the sponsors
Based on this , we further assumed that the closer of the fraction of crystalline silica contained in a possible pollutant source to that contained in the exposed respirable dusts would had a greater contribution to the exposures of the given exposure group .

A retrospective cohort study of workers from the cooperating trucking companies and the Teamsters union alive in 1985 with mortality assessed through 2000 would have a greater than an 80 % power to detect a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.25 to 1.29 attributable to diesel exposure
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.3 ( SAS Institute Inc . )
Thus if a worker is exposed to different levels of the same agent in several jobs , the sum of his cumulative exposures in each of the jobs will be proportional to the total amount of the agent deposited in his lungs .
Quantitative exposure assessments were considered practical in companies with good contextual exposure information , preferably with exposure measurements , although additional measurements of current exposure could be collected

The reason for this is not known , but the effect was repeatable .
( 2 ) A random sample of workers from each job group was measured
Cigarette smoke shares many overlapping features with diesel exhaust such as particulate , NO2 , CO , and formaldehyde , thus providing possible additivity of effects ( 12 ) , although it should be noted that coal miners do not smoke while underground .
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate the differences in the exposure levels among the job groups

Instrumentation and Analytical Procedures
Data collection for the main study was carried out between 5 and 22 June 2000 , at which time the oil shale mine was operating 4 days/week
When dust control was used on-site , the mean concentrations of airborne silica were reduced by a factor of between three and seven , the accuracy being limited by the relatively high limit of detection for silica
Because nearly 35 % of the winter samples were below the detection limit and the maximum concentration encountered was 8.7 ug/m3 ( less than half the proposed TLY ) , it is more interesting to

These results were similar at all sites , and indicate that a considerable fraction of the airborne dust is in the respirable size range
Because the measurements were taken only during the time the trains were in the tunnels , an 8-hour time weighted average can not be reported as such
